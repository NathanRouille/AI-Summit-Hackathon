# AI-Summit-Hackathon

This project aims to create a web app that predicts water levels during a flood, finds the shortest path while avoiding flooded areas, and dynamically presents the information.

## Branches

- The finalized project is in the `Final` branch [https://github.com/saimeur/AI-Summit-Hackathon/tree/Final].  
- The model training code is in the `model` branch [https://github.com/saimeur/AI-Summit-Hackathon/tree/model].  
- The graph management code is in the `graph` branch [https://github.com/saimeur/AI-Summit-Hackathon/tree/graph].  

The code uses the city of Saintes in Haute-Aquitaine as an example, as it is frequently affected by floods.
